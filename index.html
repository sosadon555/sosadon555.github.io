      <p>
        Known for his dazzling charm, rapier wit, and unrivalled humility,
        Michael is the creator of the
        <a href="https://railstutorial.org/">Ruby On Rails
        Tutorial</a> and the principal author of the
        <a href="https://learnenough.com/">
        Learn Enough to Be Dangerous</a> introductory sequence. Michael
        is also notorious as the founder of
        <a href="https://tauday.com/">Tau Days</a> and author of
        <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"><em> The Tau
        Manifesto</em></a>, but rumours that he's secretly a supervillain
        are slightly exaggerated.

      <p>
        When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
        on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
        interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
        interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.

      <p>
        You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
        Kimmer, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
        at heart. He's just as happy as shredding well-spec'd lines of code from
        a tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
